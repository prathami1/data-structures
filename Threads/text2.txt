For writers looking for a way to get their creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph can be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this tool is that nobody knows what is going to appear in the paragraph. This can be leveraged in a few different ways to force the writer to use creativity. For example, the random paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph of a story that the writer must finish. I can also be used as a paragraph somewhere inside a short story, or for a more difficult creative challenge, it can be used as the ending paragraph. In every case, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the random paragraph into the story.
